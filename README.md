## BOT :space_invader:

A internet or web bot is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet.Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. The largest use of bots is in web spidering (web crawler), in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human.


The main goal of this code is to provide a glimpse of what a bot can do and the role it can play in daily life.
# code:
I have used selenium to automate the process.
    selenium:Selenium automates browsers.Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.

 we can also use API'S to do same tasks but with more complications.
 The code is created with simplicity in mind.The prime goal of the code is to open a gmail acccount and scroll through the mails
 with intervals.
 The time parameters can be customized for personal needs.
 
any kind of improvements can be contributed:).
